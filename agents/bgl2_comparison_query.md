# Comparison with modernized boost graph library (BGL2)

The original boost graph library (BGL1, located at `/home/phil/dev_graph/boost/libs/graph/`) has been 
modernized to use C++20 (`BGL2`, located at `/home/phil/dev_graph/boost/libs/graph/modern/`).

Compare and contrast BGL2 with the current library, making sure that the following topics are covered
- The differences between the vertex and edge descriptors.
- The ability to adapt to pre-existing graph data structures.
- Strengths and weaknesses in the capabilities each library
- Other areeas of interest in the design and flexibility for the libraries.

Algorithms have not been implemented for graph-v3 and is a known limitation.

Output the result to `aggents/bgl2_comparison_result.md`.
