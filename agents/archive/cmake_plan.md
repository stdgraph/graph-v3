# Professional CMake Usage

Update the use of CMake for a high-quality, modern, professional build and test environment.

Use the CMake Template project at /home/phil/dev_graph/cmake_template as a starting point for features.
Add any additional features you think are important.

The result must work in Linux, Windows and MacOS.

Create a cmake_todo.md file with a phased, safe update of this project.
